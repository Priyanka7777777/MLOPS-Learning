## 🧩 What Are Containers?

Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient software packages. They bundle everything your application needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and configurations.

Unlike Virtual Machines (VMs), containers share the host operating system kernel, which makes them:

- Faster to start  
- Smaller in size  
- More resource-efficient  

👉 **Analogy:** Think of containers as apartments in the same building. Each apartment is independent but they share the building’s foundation, electricity, and water lines. Virtual machines, on the other hand, are like separate houses with their own land, electricity, and utilities.

## 🆚 Containers vs Virtual Machines

| Feature       | Virtual Machines (VMs) | Containers |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------|
| OS Requirements | Each VM runs its own full OS | Share the host OS kernel |
| Size          | Heavy (GBs)             | Lightweight (MBs) |
| Boot Time     | Minutes                 | Seconds |
| Isolation     | Strong isolation (separate OS per VM) | Process-level isolation |
| Use Cases     | Legacy apps, strong isolation, monoliths | Microservices, CI/CD, cloud-native applications |

**Real-world analogy:**

- **VMs:** Each delivery boy owns a separate car, GPS, and fuel.  
- **Containers:** Delivery boys share a common car fleet and GPS system, but still deliver independently.

## ⚙️ How Docker Works Under the Hood

Docker makes working with containers easy by abstracting away complex system-level details.

### Key Components:
- **Docker Engine** – Core service (daemon) that builds and runs containers.  
- **Docker CLI** – Command-line tool for interacting with Docker.  
- **Docker Hub/Registry** – Central place to share and store container images.  

### Underlying Technology:
- Uses **Linux namespaces** → Isolates processes and resources.  
- Uses **cgroups** → Controls resource allocation (CPU, memory, etc.).  
- Uses **UnionFS (layered filesystems)** → Builds container images efficiently by stacking layers.

## 🔒 Rootless Builds with Buildah

By default, Docker requires root privileges to build images. This can pose security risks in multi-user environments.  

**Buildah** solves this by allowing you to build OCI-compliant container images without root access.  

### Benefits:
- Improved security (no root required).  
- Works well with Kubernetes/OpenShift.  
- More flexible scripting than Docker.  

### Example Workflow:
```bash
# Create a new container from a base image
buildah from ubuntu

# Install packages inside the container
buildah run <container> apt-get install nginx

# Commit changes into a new image
buildah commit <container> myimage
